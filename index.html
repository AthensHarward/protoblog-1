        As we are standing at the threshold of a new world, it is important that we make time to 
        self-reflect before we take that finalizing step through the doorway. Even if we are successful 
        at speculating about what lies ahead of us, we need to make sure we understand its true 
        significance and what it means to our humanity. If we fail to acknowledge where we came from 
        and what our true nature and values are, then we risk losing the beauty of our heritage. It is 
        true that there is immense pain and suffering in our past. There is also altruism, sacrifice, 
        authenticity, friendship, and the ever-deepening pursuit of finding meaning. Just as humanity is 
        capable of intense evil, it is just as capable of good. And I may argue that evil is a direction 
        with a built-in ending and results only in destruction, whereas good is something that grows and 
        has no upper limits. <br><br>
        For the first time in human history, we are approaching an opportunity where the best parts of us 
        can truly take hold and lift us out of the world of deceit and oppression. The world of abundance 
        and enlightenment that will become available to each one of us will give us unprecedented power to 
        root out the hidden atrocities and the overt violence that has been inflicted on the masses for 
        millennia.<br><br> 
        The purpose of this blog is to explore timeless wisdom and hopefully, get that much closer to the 
        true essence of us. If we pursue who we truly are, I foresee the discovery of the good within us. 
        It is paramount that we take this good and use it as the guiding principles as we step through this 
        final door. It is possibly the only thing in our possession that will get us through this global 
        change. Perhaps it is the only real possession any of us has ever really needed and more than any 
        time in history, we need it now. Good takes effort. Good takes diligence. Good takes a sincere and 
        passionate drive, much like a sapling reaching for the light in a dark forest.
